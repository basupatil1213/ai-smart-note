## API Integration

The frontend integrates with all backend endpoints:

### Notes API (`/notes`)
- `GET /notes` - Fetch all user notes
- `GET /notes/:id` - Fetch specific note
- `POST /notes` - Create new note
- `PUT /notes/:id` - Update note
- `DELETE /notes/:id` - Delete note

### Search API (`/search`)
- `POST /search` - Semantic search with query

All API calls include:
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for better UX
- Authentication headers (Clerk tokens)
- Type-safe request/response handling

## State Management Architecture

### Zustand Store Structure
```typescript
interface NotesStore {
  // State
  notes: Note[]
  currentNote: Note | null
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
  searchResults: Note[]
  isSearching: boolean
  
  // Actions
  fetchNotes: () => Promise<void>
  createNote: (data: CreateNoteData) => Promise<Note | null>
  updateNote: (id: string, data: UpdateNoteData) => Promise<Note | null>
  deleteNote: (id: string) => Promise<boolean>
  searchNotes: (query: string) => Promise<void>
  // ... other actions
}
```

### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Centralized State**: All note-related state in one place
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, rollback on error
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient re-renders and state updates
